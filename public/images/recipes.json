The meat is not only succulent and tender but also enhanced by the earthy, nutty flavor of pistachio stuffing and the velvety zing of citrus butter. To streamline your Christmas dinner preparations, you can prepare and freeze the stuffing a month in advance. Additionally, consider buttering and stuffing the turkey the day before, keeping it chilled until you're ready to roast and serve.",
            "instructions": [
                "Begin by making the stuffing: heat the oil and butter in a pan. Add the shallots and cook for 5 minutes. Stir through the garlic and thyme and fry for 1 minute more. Transfer to a bowl; fold through the nuts, breadcrumbs and lemon zest and juice. Leave to cool a little, then add the parsley and enough egg to bind. Season well, then mix together with your hands. Set aside.",

                "Preheat the oven to gas 5, 190°C, fan 170°C. Using your fingers, gently loosen the skin at the neck end of the turkey, being careful to keep it intact. Push the citrus butter under the skin and spread it evenly over the breast.",
                "Fill the neck pocket with the stuffing*, packing it in tightly. (If you cant fit it all in, roll the remainder into balls and add to the tin for the final 45 minutes of cooking.) Tuck the skin under and secure it with a cocktail stick. Drizzle the turkey with the oil; season well. Stuff the cavity with the rosemary, plus the leftover clementine and lemon halves from the butter.",
                "Roast the turkey for 3 hours 15 minutes, basting occasionally with the pan juices. Check the bird regularly; when the skin has turned golden, cover with kitchen foil for the remaining cooking time. Add the citrus halves to the roasting tin for the final 45 minutes.",
                "As cooking times will vary according to the weight of your turkey and stuffing, ensure it is cooked all the way through with no pink meat showing. Remove from the oven and transfer to a serving plate, tipping it as you lift so the juices run back into the tin (reserve for the gravy). Cover with foil and leave to rest for 1-2 hours.",
                "For the gravy, skim the fat from the roasting tin and discard. Put the tin on the hob over a medium heat. Stir in the flour with a wooden spoon, scraping up all the sticky bits from the bottom. Pour in the wine, simmer for 1 minute, then add the stock and the cranberry sauce. Simmer until reduced; season to taste. Set aside until needed.",
                "When ready to serve, reheat the gravy and garnish the turkey with the roasted citrus fruits and bay leaves."

Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and gently sizzle the sausages over a medium-high heat for 8-10 mins, turning them, until browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate, then put the butter in the pan and heat until sizzling. Scatter in the onions, stirring them into the butter, then add the thyme sprig, bay and sugar. Give everything a final stir, then put the sausages on top and drizzle over any juices from the plate. Roast everything for 20 mins, turning the sausages halfway through.",

Tip the potatoes into a pan of cold salted water and bring to the boil, then turn down and simmer for 10-12 mins or until just cooked all the way through (the tip of a knife should slide in easily). Drain in a colander and leave for a minute. Tip the milk into the pan and bring to a simmer, then pass the potatoes through a ricer into the hot milk and mash thoroughly. Once mashed, beat with a wooden spoon or spatula over very low heat, then beat in the butter a few bits at a time. You should have extra-fluffy, smooth mash. Keep it warm.",
                "When the sausages are cooked, remove from the oven, turn the oven off and lift the sausages onto a tray. Return them to the oven to keep warm. Put the pan back on the heat and give the roasted onions a stir, they should be sticky and slightly burnt around the edges. Sizzle for a minute or two more to caramelise, then stir in the flour and cook for another minute. Splash in the vinegar, simmer for a minute, then pour over the red wine and soy, and bubble down to a gloopy paste. Pour over the stock and boil for 3-4 mins, or until you have a rich gravy. If you prefer, scoop out the thyme and bay, or just leave it in. Tip into a bowl or gravy jug with a serving spoon for the onions. Bring everything to the table and scoop a big mound of mash onto the middle of each plate, then top with the sausages and gravy."
